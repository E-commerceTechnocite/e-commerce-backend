# Authentication / Authorization

### [User auth](user-auth.md)

Users are the admins of the application. They have the rights to access the **back-office**, but can be limited with a
set of **permissions**.

### [Customer auth](customer-auth.md)

Customers do not have access to the back-office. They **do not have permissions**, they **only require authentication**
for certain actions.
